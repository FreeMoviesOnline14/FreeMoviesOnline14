- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FreeMoviesOnline14 (Marcellus Von Sacramento... is my real name).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently looking for Software Engineering or Development interships to hone my skills and expand my knowledge about the Software Industry.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Here's my e-mail: mvps815165@gmail.com
- Or, you can send me a message on LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/mvps


Note: Because I use Github to backup some of my school projects (i.e. Labs, etc.), most of my repositories are private to ensure other students will not be able to copy any of my code if they ever stumble upon my profile. Only the special repository is not private. Thank you!
